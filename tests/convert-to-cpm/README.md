# convert-to-cpm Test Scenarios

Each subfolder contains a test scenario with a `README.md` describing the setup and prompt, a `without-skill.md` showing typical agent output without the skill, and a `with-skill.md` showing expected output with the skill loaded.

The skill is considered successful if the output looks like `without-skill.md` without the skill loaded, and like `with-skill.md` with the skill loaded. If the output looks like `with-skill.md` without the skill, the skill is considered ineffective. If the output looks like `without-skill.md` with the skill loaded, the skill is considered incorrect.

## Simple

Straightforward conversions where all package versions are explicit literals, there are no version conflicts, and no MSBuild properties are involved. The agent should be able to complete the conversion without asking the user any questions beyond confirming the scope.

- **[simple-single-project](simple-single-project/)** — One project with a few inline-versioned PackageReference items
- **[simple-solution](simple-solution/)** — A solution with three projects, all packages at the same versions

## Moderate

Conversions that involve one complicating factor requiring user input. The agent should identify the issue, present options, and ask the user to decide before proceeding.

- **[moderate-version-conflicts](moderate-version-conflicts/)** — Same package appears at different versions across projects
- **[moderate-msbuild-properties](moderate-msbuild-properties/)** — Package versions defined via MSBuild properties in Directory.Build.props

## Advanced

Conversions with multiple overlapping complexities. The agent must audit several issues, present them clearly, and handle each one with separate user interactions. These scenarios test the agent's ability to maintain a coherent conversion plan across interrelated concerns.

- **[advanced-multi-complexity](advanced-multi-complexity/)** — Version conflicts, MSBuild properties, conditional PackageReference items, and references in shared .props files all in one repository
